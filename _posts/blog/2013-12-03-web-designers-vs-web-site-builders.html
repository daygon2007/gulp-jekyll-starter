<p>In todays economy we see more and more people being frugal with their marketing efforts. There are many commercials on television right now advertising free website builders, One and One, Intuit, and Wix just to name a few. The common denominator between them all is that they all advertise to be free, easy to use and will help your businesses digital image. What they don’t tell you are the charges to use some features that are important to your business. Web Designers are professionals who already know and understand the needs of your business after the initial conversation. Web designers possess the ability to create the exact website to fit your needs and in the long run are cheaper, more reliable, and you have a direct point of contact for support and updates.</p>
<h3>
<p>Pros and Cons of Website Builders</h3>
<p>The one good thing about website builders is that funny little word “free”. What most people don’t realize that it’s free to a certain extent. Do you want social media integration? Extra monthly charge. Want an image gallery? Extra monthly charge. Want a capture form? Extra monthly charge. If all you’re doing is just trying to share some simple information then a website builder may be a great option for you otherwise over the course of a year you’ll probably end up spending the same amount that you would have if you would have had your site custom built for you. The biggest thing I try to tell my clients is with website builders if you want to move away from them you can’t take that website with you. You do not own that code nor do you own the design so if you move from them you have to start over from scratch. Starting over from scratch will cause your site to be down for days or even weeks until you finish everything. Another con to website builders is they’re often times not very search engine friendly. The key to many peoples businesses in getting new customers and traffic is people being able to search for your products or services. With poor code and slow load times many search engine might not index, or rank your website, well when someone types in one of your keywords.</p>
<h3>
<p>Pros and Cons of Web Designers</h3>
<p>As a web design company we hear “Why are custom website so expensive?” the truth is, web design is an art and we are a digital version of starving artist. All too many times people believe what we do is an easy craft, but it is quite the opposite. It’s very time consuming and if there’s a bug that has to be worked out it can take hours to find that bug. Next there’s the challenge of getting everything just right for the site owner that can also be very time extensive. The cost is more time than anything. So yes web designers are naturally going to be more expensive because you’re paying for their time rather than you spending countless hours on getting the web site builder just right and nickel and diming you in the process. One downfall over the years is some web designers, especially overseas designers, can be very unreliable and unreachable once the project is complete. It is highly encouraged to go with a reputable web designer who has a web design company, even if their an individual they need to be accountable as a business otherwise you could just be getting someone who needs a quick buck and won’t be there for you when you absolutely need them. When you have a web designer build your site, that code is legally yours to do what you like, unless otherwise noted in the contract (always read the contract and there should always be a contract). Meaning if you decided not to use that web designer anymore or they fell off the planet someone else can work on the website and it can be transferred from host to host.</p>
<h3>
<p>Which would you choose?</h3>
<p>Knowing this information which route would you choose for your business? If it’s strictly an informational website with no interactivity then a website builder may be the way to go otherwise your best option will always be a web designer to get the job done right and you own the digital property. Although at times some web designers can be unreliable but always look at their portfolio and give their clients a call to give you some feedback on their experience.</p>
