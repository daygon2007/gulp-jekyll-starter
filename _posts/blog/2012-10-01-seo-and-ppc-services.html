<p>Krymson Productions is now offering SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Services and PPC (Pay Per Click) Services for all of our small business web design service clients. As a result of this expansion we are offering the SEO &amp; PPC services for $50 a month for the first 3 months and if you are satisfied with the results we will go from there.</p>
<h2>SEO Services</h2>
<p>SEO is the methods used to get your website ranking in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) based on organic search results for related keywords to your site and/or industry... without paying for advertising. We do it the right way so you don't run the risk of getting banned and de-indexed from the SERPs.</p>
<p>Unlike our competitors we will not guarantee your website to be in the number one spot. We do this because it is simply impossible  to guarantee that spot with so much competition. Studies show that the majority of people skip the first few links on the page and usually click on the third and even fourth links before even looking at the first two. For this reason we believe that ranking between positions three and seven are the best positions to be in for conversions.</p>
<h2>PPC Services</h2>
<p>PPC is paid advertising. We specialize in <a title="Google AdWords" href="http://www.google.com/adwords">Google AdWords</a>. If you don't know what they are simply just Google something and look on the right side of the screen at the ads. This is a great way of attracting attention to your site for keywords you're not ranking very high on. You pay a certain amount per click that you can designate and our AdWords specialist will help work with you every step of the way.</p>
<p>AdWords is also a great tool to help when you have a new website and you’re site is not indexing just yet due to the Google sandbox effect. It’s a great way to start attracting traffic and help turbo boost your rankings to get your site indexing faster.</p>
