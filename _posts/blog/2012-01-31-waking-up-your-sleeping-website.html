<p>Is your website "sleeping", laying dormant, or just sitting there begging to be brought back to life? I'm not talking about a redesign or a make over or an overhaul, I'm talking about adding a human element to the site saying "I show love to my website, if you email me through my contact form I'm going to answer you not an automated replying program or service". Customers or clients prefer to see an active website rather than a "sleeping" website due to neglect.</p>
<p>There are multiple way's to wake up your sleeping beauty without killing yourself. You may be thinking by now, "well I'm active on my social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc...) so I don't have to worry about my website, I can have people follow me and like me on all the sites cause everyone uses them anyway." Don't take this the wrong way but your wrong. Sure people want to hear about what specials you're running but they also want to be able to know what your company does and what they can do, so they're going to need to visit your site. What if someone never went to your social media sites? What if they came straight from Google and saw that your last update to your site was January 1, 2000? They're going to click off your site because they know your company's website is going to be old news.</p>
<p>Here are my tips on how to awaken your site and bring it back to its fullest potential. First off if your site hasn't been updated since 2000, heck if it hasn't been updated since '09 you might want to consider a redesign using current industry standards. But I digress. Add a blog to your website, take a look at <a title="Why should small businesses blog?" href="http://jonathon-harrelson.com/blog/why-should-small-businesses-blog/">this article</a> to see its advantages. If you want to be a little more creative, take a hint from search engine giant Google, do something different with your logo. Seamlessly integrate your Twitter feed (bottom right corner of this site for example) it also helps with search engine optimization. Insert a live chat feature on your site, and actually be available to answer questions even if it's only during regular business hours.Keep your website updated with the most current and most accurate information. Get creative, your website is your playground, the key is FIND A WAY TO CONVERT THOSE VISITORS IN TO NEW CLIENTELE.</p>
<p>These are my ways of waking up a website, I'm sure there are plenty more ways but these have worked wonders for me and I hope they work for you too.</p>
