<p>As a web design contractor there are certain aspects of the job that can be extremely aggravating. Punctuality and design changes are the most common aggravations amongst designers and developers. These are the tips that I use to make the life of a contractÂ  go as quick and smooth as possible.</p>
<p>We all have to deal with it because in our business it's inevitable to run across clients who are , well not exactly the most, punctual people on getting vital information to the web designer so the contract can be completed on time. Frustrating as it may be from our side you have to stop and think... Well are we dealing directly with the owner of the company that we're building the website for or are we simply dealing with a contact relaying the information to whom ever is in charge of development? Then you have to deal with how fast they can communicate with each other and then communicate back to you, the designer. You never know what they might be going through.</p>
<p>What I do before I even get a contract signed is I tell them upfront, they need to have all their information ready... similar sites they like for examples,content, images, pricing if any, contact information. Because if they are actually serious about having a website done these are the basics that they should have available from the start so when us as designers are finished with the design and coding all we have to do is plug in the information and it's done.</p>
<p>The next thing we find that most clients do it decide to change the design around numerous amounts of times which in turn drag out the project even longer and then it makes the web designer feel as though all their work is going to waste. Put in your contract somewhere a certain amount of times they can make major design changes because the best thing you can offer for them is you come up with 2-3 different mock ups and then have them pick one the they can change colors or small little layout pieces around.</p>
<p>It was short i know but this is my little tip guide on how to speed up a contract completion, reduce what I like to call "The Drag Effect".</p>
