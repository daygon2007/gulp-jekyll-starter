<p>If you're a Moz user like we are here at VersaTech Marketing, you've probably noticed some major fluctuations in external links. Not little fluctuations... Huge fluctuations. Through one of our sets of data we saw Dell go from 5.2 million external links to 1.8 million external links over the course about 2 months. That's a 65% drop in external links. That's an enormous drop off no matter how you look at it. Why is this significant you ask? Lets dive into some details.</p>

<h2>Decreased Domain Authority</h2>
<p>One major significance of the MozScape issue is domain authority is decreasing. Not that Google directly uses domain authority to rank your site, but it's a great comparison tool to see the strength of your domain versus competitors. With domain authority not working properly, for what seems to be two months now, it's causing SEO's a bit of turmoil for their reports. As a digital marketing solutions provider, with SEO being one of our solutions, we're having to explain to our clients why their data is going in the opposite direction of where we had them. This is not a good look for Moz. Rand Fishkin, one of the founders of Moz, was transparent about the issues <a href="http://moz.com/community/q/what-s-the-story-on-mozscape-updates">in a post when the issues we being reported at the end of April beginning of May</a>.</p>
<h2>Upset Clients</h2>
<p>With our SEO clients, depending on which plan you're on, you get a weekly or monthly SEO report. Our clients see the results of the faulty Mozscape and it really makes us look bad. That's any SEO organization using Moz's tools. We've looked into other tools to try and show better metrics, and we use Google Analytics to support our clients growth, but since Moz is the creator of Domain Authority it really makes it difficult. Thus far our clients understand what's going on because we have explained it to them in a way they can understand, but they were pretty upset when they received their auto generated report.</p>
<h2>We Believe in Rand!</h2>
<p>Rand Fishkin is one of my personal idols in the SEO world, and I know innovation has its road block and speed bumps. So I personally do not fault Moz on this error. As a web developer and a person who live his life in a pool of code I know finding a bug in a vast ocean of code can be one of the most challenging parts of being a developer or code engineer. I hope for their sake, they find the issue quick and get it resolved because many SEO companies like us rely on the data their tools output.</p>
