<p>Since 2004 I have been infatuated with the World Wide Web. I have spent every day working to understand it and make it better and learn the new standards. The beginning was fun because I was a newbie coming into the industry, I was green and my eyes were open to trying everything and every single way of coding. I enjoyed it so much I ended up teaching the web mastering class my senior year of high school.</p>
<p>Entering the real world I thought web design was the way of the future. Every business needs a web site so it will be an easy industry to get into and an easy industry to make money in. I was right on one aspect; it’s an easy industry to get into. Making money in the industry, a giant monster to tackle. My first 8 years in the industry, after high school, was rough and it’s still rough because as I write this, I’m at that point, but it’s gotten easier.</p>
<p>The last 3 years I have started to burn myself out on the industry, rethinking my decision to pursue this career choice. I started a company, Krymson Productions, that never really took off, and to be fair I never really was able to devote 100% of my time to it because I am the primary provider for my family and it was just too much risk at the time, and at this moment it’s still too much of a risk to devote all of my time. So I have started pursuing this passion through employment. Over the past 5-6 years I’ve struggled to keep a web design job, every company I have worked for doing web design stated the job was a permanent position, and every time it was untrue. So in the last 3 years I have just been depressed about devoting all my time to web development and that I’m going no where with it letting my family down and actually going down a different career path.</p>
<p>The last 6 months on the other hand have been really great for me and my passion for the web. I’ve gotten a couple jobs but for once I’m actually able to live and breathe and my family is able to live comfortably and it has revived my passion knowing that there is still money in this industry. I have learned more in the last 6 months that I have in the last 10 years, because I’m motivated to go further, and I now have a clearer direction of where I want to go.</p>
