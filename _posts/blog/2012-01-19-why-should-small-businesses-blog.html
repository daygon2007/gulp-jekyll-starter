<p>For most small businesses the best way to keep your website relevant is to Blog. Search engines such as Google give websites more "brownie points" to those sites who update content often. The way Google is changing their search algorithms is specifically suited for "fresh" content.</p>
<p>If you're wanting to work to get to that top page on Google take 15-20 minutes out of your day to write a blog post about what's going on in your company or field of business, keep clients and customers (consumers) informed on your industry. Do you have a fresh new idea or new products or services that your company is adding? WRITE ABOUT IT! Tell people because not only do you have a better change of scoring that extra hit from Google and getting another client/customer, your current clients/customers may be interested in that new product or service and not only have you just increased your visibility on search engines but you have also increased your revenue and profits in one shot.</p>
<p>If you can't come up with a blog post a day then at least do 1 blog post a week. Us here at Krymson Productions are going to follow suit and follow our own advise and start doing at least one to three blog posts a week to give not only our clients but everyone on the internet fresh relevant news about not only the web design industry.</p>
<p>Blogging also lets your potential clients/customers know that you're active on your website, that if they email you through your contact form on your website they know that you're going to reply to that email and in turn create more business for your company.These are our main reasons for small businesses to have and maintain a blog. If you have any questions or want more tips please feel free to <a title="Contact" href="http://krymsonproductions.com/contact/">Contact Us</a>.</p>
