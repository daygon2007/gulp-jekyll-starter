<p>When people think Search Engine Optimization (SEO), they think that only some big name SEO organization can do what's necessary on the website itself. In fact, for the most part, the everyday user can do most of the site optimization themselves. Now this is of course on the most basic levels because there are far more advanced levels of SEO reserved for those big name companies, but I digress, but just as a "contributor" (some one who writes or puts the content up on your site) it's as easy as 1 2 3 to see great ranking results.</p>
<h4>1. Keyword Focused Content</h4>
<p>When writing content, focus on a select few key terms or phrases, for example:<br />
If you're writing about security for your house and you want to rank better for "home security", make sure your content includes "home security" peppered throughout your content. Make sure the Title of your page includes "home security", and make sure your primary heading for the content included home security. In order to get someone searching for that page to click on your title, make it compelling. "Home Security - Dan's Blog" might seem like a nice title to click on when you're searching but try making it more compelling, "10 Home Security Tips For your Family". People know what to expect to see on that page, information that they're going to use. If your content is written well and compelling enough it will be shared throughout all social mediums which will also raise your SEO factor.</p>
<h4> 2. Alt Tags To Describe Images</h4>
<p>Everyone knows a picture's worth a thousand words, but to Google a picture means nothing without a nice SEO friendly description. "Alt" tags are a way to describe images so search engines can understand what that piece of graphical content is. Sticking with the same theme, if you're showing an infographic about home security Google doesn't know that the image is an infographic about home security, you would need to set up your image tag to look something like this <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/image.jpg" alt="10 Home Security Tips For your Family" />. Now Google and other search engines will know what that image is about and can index it properly, because Google is also the worlds largest image search engine, and it counts towards your content as well.</p>
<h4>3. Share it Mr. Expert!</h4>
<p>You've written great keyword rich content, you have stunning images, share them with the world through social media channels and blogs. Don't stop there though, you're an expert in your industry or hobby, share what you know. Answer questions, become affiliated with reputable sites and have them share your content. The more your contents gets read and shared the more relevant search engines see your content when it comes to the search terms of phrases you are targeting, the better you will rank.</p>
<p>There you have it, in three easy steps you now know as a content contributor how to make your content rank better without having a bunch of SEO knowledge.</p>
