<h3>Brief Overview</h3>
<p>Recently (as of the time of this post), a buddy of mine and I decided we're going to create a membership site to promote our Twitch streams, bring in additional revenue, help out other gamers, and raise money for charity as well (because we try to be kind hearted individuals). Sitting down and actually thinking about it, this was going to be a pretty big project, much bigger than I anticipated. With that being said I thought I would write an article series through out each step of the process going over almost everything that goes into developing a membership site, the hurdles we're going to face along the way, and the logic behind our decisions. I hope you find this series interesting and informative, and feel free to contact me and ask questions that you may run into. Now let's dive in.</p>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Before anyone starts building, developing or marketing anything there has to be a roadmap in place to show what's got to happen from start to finish in order for the venture to be successful. This is the stage that my buddy Jacob and I are at right now. This membership site is going to have different levels, free, tier one paid, tier two paid. We're trying to figure out which tiers get which privileges and for how much. We are having to ask ourselves questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the fees going to be monthly or yearly?</li>
<li>Why should you pay to join?</li>
<li>What are the benefits of joining?</li>
<li>What do you get out of it in the long run?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a hand full of questions we are asking ourselves.</p>
<p>For us, prior to getting to the planning stages, we came up with a brand identity and secured our domain name. We're keeping it under wraps for now during this process, this is a marketing tactic to build hype, and the hype will be worth it. Check back soon for part 2.</p>
