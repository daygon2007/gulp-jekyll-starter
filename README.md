<h1>Gulp-Jekyll Starter Bundle</h1>
<p>This bundle comes out of the box with Gulp already set up to run with Jekyll. The gulp file contains tasks to concatinate and minify javascript and scss and put them in the correct folders for production. The file also runs browsersync to load the production folder and refreshes the browser automagically when a changed file within the source javascript folder (_js), the source css folder (_scss), and the source images folder (_img) is saved.</p>

<p>Feel free to fork this, share it, and help me build upon this as it's still very basic.</p>
